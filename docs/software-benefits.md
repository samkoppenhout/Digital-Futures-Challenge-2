# Benefits of the Software

## Introduction

Modern banks almost all use some form of software to perform transactions, for a multitude of reasons. By introducing even the most simple software solutions to a banking space you can reduce the requirement on human workers, meaning removing many of the key areas of human error and allowing transactions to take place 24 hours a day, increasing the benefit to the customers. According to the Bank of England the average bank settlement totaled over £717,661,000,000 per day for the first quarter of 2024[1]; Performing this number of transactions manually would be almost impossible, slowing down customer access to money and services and dramatically increasing the cost of labour for banks. This software is a simple solution to allow transactions for many parallel accounts, as well as a record of each.

## Key Features

- The software allows users to deposit and withdraw money from their account.
- The software keeps a track of all transactions.
- The software allows users to print a statement of their previous transactions, with helpful colours to improve the presentation of information.
- The software checks for invalid transactions, such as trying to withdraw below their balance, and blocks them.
- The software reports back to the user on both successful and unsuccessful transactions so they know where their money is at all times.
- The software allows accounts to be given an overdraft which allows them to spend under their balance up to an arranged limit.

## Benefits of the software

### For the customer

The software allows the customer to keep track of their finances at all times, even when a conventional bank may be closed. Transactions can be checked and authorised almost immediately, allowing faster access to their money. Improving the experience for customers in this way would draw more people into using the bank, increasing the potential for revenue for the company using this software.

### For the bank

The software allows the bank to keep track of multiple accounts without paperwork, allowing more concurrent transactions and reducing the requirement for a large number of staff, dramatically reducing overheads while simultaneously increasing income potential. Keeping all accounts’ transaction history centrally on a computer system also means that auditing and accounting on the banks side is easier, as all the required information is in a single, easily accessible location.

## Risks

Although the software is both safe and easy to use, there are some important considerations to make. Firstly, the software does not currently have any method of securing access to an account, so only authorised users should be able to access the computer with this software loaded.
Secondly, the software is vulnerable to human error; If the user inputs information incorrectly then it may still be processed as a legitimate transaction. Traditional manually telling processes are also vulnerable to this however, and the software makes transactions clear and visible so is still an improvement for both banks and customers in this regard.

## Further Development

There are some features which are being considered for the future development of this application. Firstly, a user authentication system would allow more confidence from customers that their transactions are being handled securely, and that their accounts are safe from other agents attempting to steal money.
Secondly, a user interface would be useful to allow users to input amounts into the software directly so that they have more direct control over their accounts.

## Conclusion

In conclusion this application provides a large amount of functionality and has the potential to improve customers banking experience, increase bank revenue and decrease bank spending. Although there are a couple of risks as addressed above which are being focused on in future development, the software in its current state is undoubtedly a very large improvement over running a bank without any telling software for all parties involved.
