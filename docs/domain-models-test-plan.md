# Domain Models and Test Plan

## Use of Agile for Project Planning

A kanban board was used to track progress on this project. A screenshot of this has been included in image-1, showing an example of a user story written out, with its domain model linked and a 'definition-of-done' included for tracking and project management purposes.

## User Stories

### Core Features

User Story 1:

- As a user,
- I should be able to deposit funds,
- So I can put money in the account.

User Story 2:

- As a user,
- I should be able to withdraw funds if I have sufficient balance,
- So I can withdraw money from the account.

User Story 3:

- As a user,
- I should be able to print an account statement,
- So I can see my balance and deposit/withdrawal history.

### Additional Features

Generative AI was used in the development of the user following user stories.

User Story 4:

- As a user,
- I want the credits and positive balances in my bank statement to appear in green text, and debits and negative balances to appear in red text,
- For easier readability.

User Story 5:

- As a user,
- I want to have an overdraft facility option for my account,
- So that I can withdraw funds even if my balance goes below zero.

User Story 6:

- As a user,
- when I attempt to withdraw funds that would result in a negative balance, I want the withdrawal to be allowed only up to the value of my configured overdraft limit,
- So that I do not over spend

## Domain Models

The domain models used for the core features can be seen in "image-2". The domain models for the additional features are available in "image-3", and were constructed with the help of generative AI.
